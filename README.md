The title of my project is ChitChat.

We've developed a website using a Node.js server, allowing users to chat with others on the platform. Users can enter the chat with a chosen username, sending messages visible to all participants, akin to a group chat. Additionally, the website features a private chat platform, enabling users to engage in one-on-one conversations. These private chats are stored in the MongoDB database for future reference.

Summary of the Steps:

1. We wanted to create a project related to servers so that we could learn the use of sockets.
2. We searched for project ideas and we came across the idea of making a chatting website and it seemed interesting.
3. We installed the Node.js package.
4. We initialized Node.js project from the terminal.
5. We made 2 files that is , server.js and index.html.
6. All the server side code was written inside server.js whereas the client side code was written in index.html.
7. Fetched username from the user and stored it a UsersMap in server side and made the interface for group chat.
8. Made the interface for private chat with the current online users.
9. Used MongoDB to store every message along with the sender username, receiver username and the timestamp.
10. Fetched all the messages between the user and the selectedUser on selecting a user from the Online Users list and displayed it.
11. Fetched all the messages on the event of a chat message sent between the user and the selected user and displayed it.
12. Performed final touches in the index.html file for styling.

We have hosted our website for free using render.com so that others can use this website for chatting on their respective devices.
